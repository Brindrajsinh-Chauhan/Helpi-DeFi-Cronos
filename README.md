# Helpi-DeFi-recent

We are a Decentralized protocol that allows users an easy access to the DeFi space by allowing them to use fiat-based currencies for day-to-day exchanges and cross-border remittances. The protocol is equiped with vesting capabilities allowing users to withdraw their rewards in a periodic manner rather than a massive cash-out format.

Our platform also allows users to send money to their families and friends in other countries directly in their native currency removing the double conversion process and conversion fees.
